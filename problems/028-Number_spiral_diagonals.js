/**
 * Problem 28 - Number spiral diagonals
 *
 * @see {@link https://projecteuler.net/problem=28}
 *
 * Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction,
 * a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows :
 *
 *            21 22 23 24 25
 *            20  7  8  9 10
 *            19  6  1  2 11
 *            18  5  4  3 12
 *            17 16 15 14 13
 *
 * It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101 :
 *    ->   1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 + 25 = 101
 *
 * What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral
 * formed in the same way?
